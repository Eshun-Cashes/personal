          <p>
            I am a Fullstack Web and Application Developer. A keyboardist and a heavy duty machinery operator. 
            I am the co-founder of InIT Consultium and Triumphant Greenhouse Farms. 
            I love playing video games especially FIFA and PES and love learning new things
            and new ways of doing what I know how to do already. My strongest and weakest point is my mum.

          <h3>Coding and Development</h3>
        
          <p>
            I started learning coding as something to take me out of boredom any time I feel like doing something.
            Little by little it became part of me that I always wanted to do it before I go to bed every night.
            As time pass by, my interest grew stronger so I had to dedicate my full time to coding and development.
            I learnt it through self learning and a friend who was at an advanced level. 
          </p>

          <h3>Heavy Duty Machinery Operating</h3>
          <p>
            This came about after completeing high school. I couldn't continue to the University straight away because
            of financial issues, so I had to decide on learning a trade or just live a normal life in the hope 
            of securing financial support to further my education. So I settled for heavy duty machinery <em>Backhoe, 
              Excavator, Roller, Dumper and Pill Loader.
            </em>
          </p>

          <h3>Other Interest</h3>

          <p>
            My love for music lead to the learning of keyboard which i often play out of boredom and stress. I am 
            not a pro keyboardist tho but like the saying goes, practice makes man perfect, I believe I will one 
            day become of the pro.
          </p>

          <p>
            My other side that I can't overlook is my writing skills. I am not a literature student though but I think 
            writing was ingrained in me before I was even born. I love writing articles and sometimes pieces some 
            pieces together to form a very peaceful piece lol... As this site is still under development and updates 
            on daily basis so I think, I will soon start writting some articles here...
